# Open Comunity Management
Backend for social media community management. **STILL A VERY RAW CLAY ;)**

In a nutshell it's a backend for managing social media community posts. Among the core features I'm looking to implement are:
- Team post creation and review
- Team post idea sharing
- Post scheduling and publishing to social media platforms

## Core Principles
- **Simple, Stupid**: The system should be simple to use and understand. 
- **Minimal Dependencies**: The system should have minimal dependencies. You only need to know Go to be able to contribute. Not necesarly reinventing the wheel, but not using a library for every little thing. (Unless we develop it ourselves)
- **Modular**: The system should be modular. It should be easy to add new features and maintain the existing ones.
